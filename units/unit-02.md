# Lesson 2 · People vs sessions

**The question this lesson asks:** how many people used your app, and how many came back?

## How it goes

1. **[The class slides](slides/02-people-vs-sessions/slides.html)**, in class with your lecturer.
2. **The guided walkthrough, with your assistant.** In the Claude app: **Code → + New**, check the chips say
   **Data-mindset** and your repository, and say: ***"Let's practice lesson 2"***. It takes you through
   everything, one step at a time: loading the practice data, deciding what each number means, building
   your board, and checking it.
3. **[Lesson 2 · Questions](checker/?lesson=lesson-02)**, answered from [your dashboard](dashboard/#unit-02), then the memo.

## What you'll build

On [your dashboard's **lesson 2** board](dashboard/#unit-02):
- **Visits**, **browsers**, and **people**: your best estimate of how many humans that is.
- **Came back**: how many people visited more than once, and **visits per person**.

It uses the same practice data as lesson 1.

<!-- For your assistant: the page stops here. Everything below is your brief for this lesson; the team doesn't see it on the page. -->

**The question this lesson asks:** how many people used your app, and how many came back?

## 0. The class slides

Start with [the slides for this lesson](slides/02-people-vs-sessions/slides.html) (arrow keys to move). The
walkthrough below assumes you have been through them.

## 1. Load the practice data

You loaded this data in lesson 1, and it serves lesson 2 too: skip this step. Load it again
only if you have loaded another lesson's data since.

[the practice data](data/copy.html?f=lesson-02)

The practice data is a few weeks of visits to the photo app. It is generated, and it is
realistic on purpose: it has the same problems real data has. Some of them are traps.

Loading it again later replaces only the practice data (rows marked `is_synthetic`). Your
own test runs, and any real visits, are never touched.

## 2. Build: "Who used the app?"

> **Build it with your AI assistant.** In the Claude app (or [claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code)): **Code → + New**,
> check the chip above the message box says **Data-mindset**, and type: *"Let's practice lesson 2"*.
> It walks you through everything below, one step at a time.

Build these numbers on [your dashboard's **lesson 2** board](dashboard/#unit-02), **each in its own panel**:

| Number | What it should tell the reader |
| --- | --- |
| Visits | How many times the app was opened |
| Browsers | How many different browsers opened it |
| People | Your best estimate of how many humans that is |
| Came back | How many people, or what share, visited more than once |
| Visits per person | On average |

Under **every** number goes one sentence that says exactly what it counts:
*we count …, from …, excluding …, because …*

**Already decided**, because the questions use these exact meanings:
- A **person** is an account. A browser that never signed in, in any visit, counts as one person.
- A person's **visits**: for an account, the visits in which it signed in; for a browser that never
  signed in, all of its visits.
- **Came back** is a person with more than one visit. Show it as a share of People too (one decimal).
- **Visits per person** is Visits divided by People (two decimals).

**Yours to decide:** which visits count at all, and why. Your AI assistant asks what each number
should count, asks about anything you left open (sometimes which column you mean: look it up), and
writes the sentence from what you said. It's yours to change any time.

**In scope:** the numbers above, their definitions, and anything you need to check them.
**Not yet:** charts over time, funnels, heatmaps, segments. Those come in later lessons.

## 3. Check yourself

Open [**Lesson 2 · Questions**](checker/?lesson=lesson-02) and answer its questions **from your
dashboard**. A wrong answer says "not quite" and nothing else. When all are right, you're done
with the numbers.

Some questions ask about things your panel doesn't show. That's on purpose. **Now you lead:**
decide what your dashboard is missing, say what it should count, and ask your assistant to build
it. It goes on your board under **On your own**. Answer from the dashboard, never from a one-off
count.

If an answer won't come out right, don't guess. Follow one participant from the raw rows
to your dashboard and see where your count and theirs part ways.

## 4. The memo (half a page)

Write it at the end of [Lesson 2 · Questions](checker/?lesson=lesson-02). Your draft is saved as you type.
